# Struts 2 Direct Web Remoting (DWR) plugin

**DEPRECATED**: The plugin has been marked as deprecated since Struts 6.7.0 as there is no active development
nor DWR doesn't support JakartaEE!

This plugin allows to use Struts validation via DWR as remote beans.
You will find more details in [documentation](https://struts.apache.org/plugins/dwr/).

## Installation
Just drop this plugin JAR into `WEB-INF/lib` folder or add it as a Maven dependency.
